## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or potential risks in this project, please report them **privately**.

- 🐛 Open an issue and mark it with the label `security`

**Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities** before a fix is implemented.

## 🔍 Scope of Security

This is a **static personal portfolio**. However, we still care about:

- ✅ Third-party dependency vulnerabilities
- ✅ Open redirect risks (if forms or links are used)
- ✅ Information leakage (personal/contact info in the repo)
- ✅ XSS or HTML injection risks (if user input is ever collected)

## ❗ Excluded from Scope

- Phishing attempts or social engineering
- Attacks requiring physical access
- Browser-specific bugs (like in Chrome or Firefox)

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

- No sensitive credentials or secrets in repo
- Uses HTTPS for all links
- Dependencies are regularly reviewed and updated
- External libraries are used from trusted CDNs or pinned versions
